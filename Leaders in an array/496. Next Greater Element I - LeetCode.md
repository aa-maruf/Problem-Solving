>The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.</br></br>You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.</br></br>For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.</br></br>Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

 

`Example 1:`

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]</br>
Output: [-1,3,-1]</br>
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
Example 2: 

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4] </br>
Output: [3,-1] </br>
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows: 
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000 </br>
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1e4 </br>
All integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique.</br>
All the integers of nums1 also appear in nums2.

## Solution - 1:
```c++
    class Solution {
    public:
    vector<int> nextGreaterElement(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& a) {
        int max = -1, n = a.size();
        unordered_map <int, int> m;
        
        for (int i = n -1 ; i >= 0; i--) {
            m[a[i]] = max; 
            int j = i;
            
            while (j < n && i) {
                 max = (a[i- 1] < a[j] ? a[j] : (a[i-1] < m[a[i]] ? m[a[i]] : -1));
                 if (max!= -1) break;
                 j++;
            }
        }
        
        vector<int> ans = nums1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); i++) {
            ans[i] = m[nums1[i]];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
