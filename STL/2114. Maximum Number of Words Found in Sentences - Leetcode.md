2114. Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences
# Problem Statement
A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.

You are given an array of strings sentences, where each sentences[i] represents a single sentence.

Return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.

 

Example 1:

Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]</br>
Output: 6 </br>
Explanation: 
- The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
- The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
- The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.
Example 2:

Input: sentences = ["please wait", "continue to fight", "continue to win"]</br>
Output: 3</br>
Explanation: It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number of words. </br>
In this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same number of words.
 

Constraints:

1 <= sentences.length <= 100 </br>
1 <= sentences[i].length <= 100 </br>
sentences[i] consists only of lowercase English letters and ' ' only. </br>
sentences[i] does not have leading or trailing spaces. </br>
All the words in sentences[i] are separated by a single space.

### Solution - 1
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int mostWordsFound(vector<string>& s) {
        return 1+accumulate (begin(s),end(s), 0 , [](int res,const auto &x){
            return max (res,(int) count(begin(x),end(x),' '));
        });
    }
};

```

### Solution - 2

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int mostWordsFound(vector<string>& s) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            ans = max (ans, (int)count(s[i].begin(), end(s[i]), ' '));
        }  /// count long long return kre. tai typecast kra.
        return ans + 1;
    }
};

```

### Solution - 3
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int mostWordsFound(vector<string>& s) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            stringstream iss(s[i]);
            string word;
            int cnt = 0;
            while(iss >> word){
                cnt++;
            }
            ans = max (ans, cnt);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
