## Problem Statement:
Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
Example 3:

Input: s = "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 1e5
s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.


## Solutions: 
.... We can also use the bucket sort here. Solution will be uploaded later.
## Solution -1 :
```c++
    class Solution {
public:
    string frequencySort(string s) {
        map<char,int> m;

        for (auto c : s) {
            m[c] ++;
        }

        vector<pair<int, char>> v ;

        for (auto &[f,s] : m) {
            v.push_back ({s,f});
        }

        sort (begin(v), end(v), greater<pair<int, char>>());

        string ans  = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
            auto &[t, c] = v[i];
            ans += string(t, c);
            // ans.append(t,c); 
        }

        return ans;

    }
};
```
## Solution - 2 :
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    
    string frequencySort(string s) {
        map<char,int> freq;
        for (auto c : s) {
            freq[c]++;
        }
        sort(s.begin(),s.end(),[&freq](char a, char b){
            if (freq[a] == freq[b])
                return a > b;
            else
                return freq[a] > freq[b];
        });
        return s;
        
    }
};

```
## Solution - 2 : similar. sending freq into lambda as const.
```c++
//-----------solve 3 using lambda expression --------------
// M.at() is for const and non const where indexing is only for non const.
// Here we are passing map as constant, so use at() function
class Solution {
public:
    
    string frequencySort(string s) {
        map<char,int> freq;
        for (auto c : s) {
            freq[c]++;
        }
        sort(s.begin(),s.end(),[freq](char a, char b){
            if (freq.at(a) == freq.at(b))
                return a > b;
            else
                return freq.at(a) > freq.at(b);
        });
        return s;
        
    }
};

```

## Solution - 2 : similar, not using lambda.
```c++
/// custom compare funcion

class Solution {
public:
    static map<char,int>freq;
    static bool compare (char a, char b) {
        if(freq[a] == freq[b])
            return a > b;
        return freq[a] >freq[b];
    }
    string frequencySort(string s) {
        for (auto c : s) {
            freq[c]++;
        }
        sort(s.begin(),s.end(),compare);
        freq.clear();
        return s;
        
    }
};
map<char,int> Solution :: freq;
```
## Notes:
- When passing a member function as a callback to std::sort, it needs to be either a static member function or a non-member function. Making it static allows it to be used directly without requiring an instance of the class.
-  Since compare is a member function of the class Solution, it needs access to the static member variable freq. Static member functions can access only static member variables of the class directly.
-  M.at() is for const and non const where indexing is only for non const. In third solution,  we are passing map as constant [not as a reference], so use at() function.
