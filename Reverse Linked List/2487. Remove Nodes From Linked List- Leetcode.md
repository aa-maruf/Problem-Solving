>You are given the head of a linked list.</br>
Remove every node which has a node with a strictly greater value anywhere to the right side of it.</br>
Return the head of the modified linked list.</br>

 

`Example 1:`


Input: head = [5,2,13,3,8]</br>
Output: [13,8]</br>
Explanation: The nodes that should be removed are 5, 2 and 3.
- Node 13 is to the right of node 5.
- Node 13 is to the right of node 2.
- Node 8 is to the right of node 3.</br>
Example 2:

Input: head = [1,1,1,1]</br>
Output: [1,1,1,1]</br>
Explanation: Every node has value 1, so no nodes are removed.
 

Constraints:

The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range [1, 1e5].</br>
1 <= Node.val <= 1e5</br>

```c++
    class Solution {
    public:
        ListNode* removeNodes(ListNode* head) {
            
            ListNode* curr = head;
            ListNode* prev = NULL;
            ListNode* next = head -> next;
            
            while (curr != NULL) {
                next = curr -> next;
                curr -> next = prev;

                }
                else {
                    prev -> next = curr -> next;
                }
                curr = curr -> next;
            }
            curr = Head;
            prev = NULL;
            
            while (curr != NULL) {
                next = curr -> next;
                curr -> next = prev;
                prev = curr;
                curr = next;
            }
            return prev;
        }
};

```

## Solution - 2
```c++
    /// Using Recursion
    class Solution {
    public:
        ListNode* removeNodes(ListNode* head) {
            if (head == NULL)
                return NULL;
            head -> next = removeNodes(head -> next);
            return head-> next && head-> val < head-> next-> val ? head-> next : head;
        }
};
