# Problem Statement:
Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2</br>
Output: "bacdfeg"</br>
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcd", k = 2</br>
Output: "bacd"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1e4 </br>
s consists of only lowercase English letters. </br>
1 <= k <= 1e4

### Solution - 1:
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseStr(string s, int k) {
        int n = s.size();

            int i = 0;
            while(i  < n ){
                if ((n-i) < k) {
                    reverse(s.begin() +i, s.end()); 
                    break;
                }
                reverse(s.begin()+i, s.begin()+i+k);
                i+= 2*k;
            }
        return s;
    }
};

```
